# CURSE-8
A CHIP-8 emulator, with libcurses

## Overview
This repository contains two items:
* CURSE-8, a CHIP-8 interpreter that uses libcurses to play in a terminal.
* recompile.pl, a static recompiler that turns CHIP-8 .ch8 binary files into C code
* naive.pl, a much simpler static recompiler :)
